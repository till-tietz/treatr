Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Till",
           family = "Tietz",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: Given a treatment indicator linked to geographic units treatr allows you to compute the percent area of an overlapping larger geographic unit that was treated. 
    You can also simply calculate the percent area of intersection between sets of two geographic units.
